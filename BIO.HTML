  <div class="section-title"><b>Childhood Years</b></div>
    <p>
        If I were to start my story, I think this is the best one that I could think of. I am Ivan and this is how my story begins. As a kid, I was very playful and hyper even though I looked like a stick that time. I remember when I had my first crush during my Kinder days, that’s the first time I felt the “kilig” as every kid feels when they admire someone. When I was a Grade 1 student, I remember passing messages to my crush through paper as if we didn't have anyone else around. I guess that was my first puppy love. As time went by, I created relationships that I didn’t know I could have. I experienced things good and bad. Bullies are prominent when you’re that skinny kid from grade school and a kind of smarty-pants. As I make enemies, I love making friends too — with my neighbors, classmates, and even kids that are older than me. Extroverted is what I can describe myself at that time, I love having connections with people. I can say that ‘Ivan’ was very smart, knowing that I was the first honor from Grades 1-4. I was a consistent honor student from Kindergarten to Grade 6. Life was very bearable and I didn't have to think about anything. Kids that were my bullies before became my friends. Those who were my friends before, became strangers. That was the most stressful thing that I was going through during that time. I was so busy building relationships that also built my personality that grew as life goes on. Then finally, I graduated from Grade school. Even though I don’t know what path to take with my journey.

  <div class="section-title"><b>Teenage Years</b></div>
    <p>
        I guess I can start my teenage years where I did what most all the males do to be called “binata”, circumcision. After that, I felt like a big old man that can do everything. I became physically mature and transitioned from skinny during childhood, to fat, and then to fit. Since the time I graduated, I barely see my grade school friends anymore. I transferred when I entered high school. From Arellano University, I transferred to Pasig City Science High School but there was a catch. I was about to start my journey with APEC when my friend that was older than me that was already studying in PCSHS messaged me. “Ivan, nakita mo na ba yung waitlist ng Pasig Science?”. I was shocked and excited because everything was already ready, even me, to enter high school in APEC. As I looked for the waitlist, I saw my name — I was so happy because I got the opportunity to study in a Sci High although I have this stereotype that most of my classmates will be a nerd. New environment, new Ivan. As I entered the campus, I saw different kinds of teenagers like me. But it wasn’t the same with my expectations, they’re not nerds. Grade 7 was a mix of both good and bad since I was like testing the waters back then. Grade 8 was the best one as I found special people that are close to my heart even now. But just like other fantasy stories, there are hindrances. Pandemic started, it felt like everything was set to reset. Lost most of the special people as I struggled with my mental health that up until now my parents didn’t know. Skipping Grades 9-10, I found people that made everything bearable and made me feel that I can go up once again with the help of different people that support me and love me for who I am. To cut the story of my teenage life short — I found the right people, I matured through different experiences, and I graduated not just in high school but also with my old self.

    <div class="section-title"><b>College Years</b></div>
    <p>
        College life, a new journey that I took bravely. Having these uncertainties was the biggest struggle as I entered college. I wasn’t sure what program to take and what school to go to. I only applied for UP when I was in my SHS and unfortunately I didn’t pass the exam. As for FEU, my program was different when I passed the entrance exam and I regretted it since it is not applicable for FEUTech. The only choice I have at that time is UE. My mom was an alumni and encouraged me when I didn't know what university to go to by saying, “‘Nak, try mo kaya sa UE?”. I passed the exam and then in a snap of a finger, I’m enrolled. It wasn’t in any of my expectations since I was so fixated on limited options that sadly, didn’t go as planned. I just did what I had to do, to study. During the First Year, I’m in survival mode. I’m not talking to anyone in the first few weeks and focused on the lecture. “Focus na sa aral, wala na muna masyado leisure.” was my motto, but as always, it went on a different path. I met one of my batchmates from high school and that made me feel relieved that I know someone in that block. As time went by, I met new people that became my friends and had a new circle. They made my freshman year easy and fun. The second year was full of unexpected things, just like some of my friends transferred to another school with a different program — it made me realize that in college, changes are inevitable. With these experiences from childhood up until now, I can say that I’m proud of myself. I’m always scared at first but always try it after and take risks that I know can help me to grow not just as a student but also as a person. As the real world comes closer, I think that I should still enjoy this college life together with acknowledging the responsibilities that I should be aware of.
